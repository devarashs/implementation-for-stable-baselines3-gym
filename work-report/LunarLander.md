# Work Report: LunarLander-v3 Environment

## Project Overview

This work report details the implementation, training, and evaluation of a Deep Q-Network (DQN) agent for solving the LunarLander-v3 environment from Gymnasium.

## Environment Description

**LunarLander-v3** is a classic control problem where an agent must successfully land a lunar module on a landing pad. The agent controls the main engine and two side engines to navigate the lander through gravity and atmospheric conditions.

### Key Characteristics

- **Observation Space**: 8-dimensional continuous state space
  - `x, y`: Lander coordinates (normalized position)
  - `vel_x, vel_y`: Linear velocities in x and y directions
  - `angle`: Lander orientation angle (radians)
  - `angular_vel`: Angular velocity
  - `leg1_contact, leg2_contact`: Boolean ground contact sensors
- **Action Space**: 4 discrete actions controlling lander engines
  - `Action 0`: Do nothing (coast, no engine firing)
  - `Action 1`: Fire left orientation engine (rotate right)
  - `Action 2`: Fire main engine (thrust upward)
  - `Action 3`: Fire right orientation engine (rotate left)
- **Goal**: Land safely between the flag markers with minimal fuel consumption
- **Episode Termination**: Landing, crashing, or flying off-screen

### Reward Function Design

**Multi-Component Reward Structure**:

- **Landing Success**: +100 to +140 points for safe landing between flags
- **Crash Penalty**: -100 points for crashing
- **Distance Reward**: Positive reward for moving closer to landing pad
- **Velocity Penalty**: Negative reward for high landing velocity
- **Fuel Consumption**: -0.3 points per main engine fire, -0.03 per side engine
- **Leg Contact**: +10 points for each leg touching ground
- **Episode Completion**: Additional reward for successful mission completion

**Reasoning Behind Reward Design**:

- **Multi-Objective**: Balances safety, efficiency, and accuracy
- **Shaped Rewards**: Provides learning signal throughout trajectory
- **Fuel Efficiency**: Realistic constraint encouraging optimal control
- **Safety Priority**: Large penalties for crashes discourage reckless behavior

## Algorithm Selection: Deep Q-Network (DQN)

**Rationale**: DQN was chosen for this environment because:

- **Discrete Actions**: Perfect fit for Q-learning with discrete engine controls
- **Complex State Space**: Neural network can handle 8-dimensional continuous observations
- **Sample Efficiency**: Experience replay helps learn from successful landings
- **Proven Performance**: DQN has demonstrated success on LunarLander variants
