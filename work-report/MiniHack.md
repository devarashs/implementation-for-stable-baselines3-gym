# Work Report: MiniHack-Room-5x5-v0 Environment

## Project Overview

This work report details the implementation, training, and evaluation of a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent for solving the MiniHack-Room-5x5-v0 environment, a grid-based navigation task derived from NetHack.

## Environment Description

**MiniHack-Room-5x5-v0** is a simplified version of the classic rogue-like game NetHack, designed for reinforcement learning research. The environment presents a 5x5 room where an agent must navigate to reach a goal tile.

### Key Characteristics

- **Observation Space**: Multi-input observation including:
  - **Character Map**: 2D array of ASCII symbols (`@` = agent, `>` = goal, `.` = floor, `-|` = walls)
  - **Color Map**: Numerical color codes for display rendering
  - **Misc Features**: Additional game state information
  - **Stats**: Agent health, inventory, and status indicators
- **Action Space**: Discrete actions from NetHack action set
  - `Action 0`: Move North (up)
  - `Action 1`: Move South (down)
  - `Action 2`: Move East (right)
  - `Action 3`: Move West (left)
  - `Actions 4+`: Additional NetHack commands (search, inventory, etc.)
- **Goal**: Navigate the agent ('@') to the staircase/goal tile ('>')
- **Episode Termination**: Goal reached, agent dies, or maximum steps exceeded

### Reward Function Design

**Original Sparse Reward**:

- **Goal Achievement**: +1 when agent reaches goal tile
- **No Intermediate Rewards**: No rewards for exploration or progress

**Custom Reward Shaping via Wrappers**:

1. **WallPenaltyWrapper**:

```python
if prev_pos == curr_pos and action < 4:
    reward -= 0.1
```

- **Purpose**: -0.1 penalty for attempting invalid moves
- **Effect**: Discourages wall-bumping behavior
- **Learning**: Teaches spatial awareness of boundaries

2. **GoalRewardWrapper**:

```python
if goal_pos == agent_pos:
    reward += 1.0
    terminated = True
```

- **Purpose**: Clear goal detection and reward assignment
- **Effect**: Ensures consistent goal recognition
- **Learning**: Provides definitive success signal

**Design Reasoning**:

- **Minimal Shaping**: Preserves challenge while adding basic guidance
- **Spatial Learning**: Wall penalties teach environment boundaries
- **Clear Success**: Explicit goal detection prevents ambiguity

## Algorithm Selection: Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)

**Rationale**: PPO was chosen for this environment because:

- **Multi-Input Observations**: PPO with MultiInputPolicy handles complex observation spaces
- **Discrete Actions**: Policy gradient methods work well with discrete action spaces
- **Sparse Rewards**: PPO can learn from delayed rewards with proper exploration
- **Stable Learning**: Clipped objective prevents destructive policy updates

## Implementation Details

### Custom Environment Wrappers

#### 1. WallPenaltyWrapper

```python
class WallPenaltyWrapper(Wrapper):
    def step(self, action):
        prev_pos = self.unwrapped.last_observation
        obs, reward, terminated, truncated, info = self.env.step(action)
        curr_pos = self.unwrapped.last_observation

        if prev_pos == curr_pos and action < 4:
            reward -= 0.1
        return obs, reward, terminated, truncated, info
```

**Purpose**: Penalizes attempts to move into walls or invalid positions.

#### 2. GoalRewardWrapper

```python
class GoalRewardWrapper(Wrapper):
    def step(self, action):
        obs, reward, terminated, truncated, info = self.env.step(action)

        if info.get("chars", None) is not None:
            chars = info["chars"]
            if b">" in chars:
                goal_pos = tuple(zip(*np.where(chars == b">")))[0]
                agent_pos = tuple(zip(*np.where(chars == b"@")))[0]
                if goal_pos == agent_pos:
                    reward += 1.0
                    terminated = True
        return obs, reward, terminated, truncated, info
```

**Purpose**: Provides clear goal detection and reward when agent reaches the staircase.
